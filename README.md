# YassirMovies
A concept online movie library app based on yassir's visual identity and some of my own modification

## Features
### User interfaces :
- A beautiful on boarding screen to welcome you.
- A home screen with navigation bar to navigate between the movie discovery page and the show discovery page.
- A details pages for both movies and shows.

### used dependencies :
- I used Jetpack compose for this app as it is the latest and greatest from team android and it decreases the dev time by a lot.
- I used Kotlin Ktor Client dependency for the network calls as it provides the simplest api compared to libraries like retrofit and volley.
- I used android navigation component for compose to implement the single activity application.
- I based the application on the MVVM architectural pattern for better separation between the domain logic and the ui logic.
- I used Coil for image loading and caching.
